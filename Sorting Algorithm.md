# <a name="_n35gb7ms0fxn"></a>Task: Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Performance Analysis.

the task consists of two stages:

Stage 1:

1\. Implement the following sorting algorithms:

`   `a) Counting Sort

`   `b) Quick Sort

`   `c) Bubble Sort

`   `d) Merge Sort

`   `e) Radix Sort

Input: Unsorted list of elements.

Output: Sorted list in ascending order.

2\. Utilize the provided test function, **test\_sorting\_algorithm(sort\_func)**, to verify the correctness of your sorting functions. This function will run random test cases and compare the sorted output with the expected result.

3\. Use the provided plotting function, **plot\_sorting\_performance(algorithms)**, to analyze the performance of the sorting algorithms. The input to this function should be a **dictionary** containing the names of the sorting algorithms and their corresponding function references.

Stage 2:

Extend each of the sorting algorithms from Stage 1 to include a counter that tracks the number of operations performed during the sorting process. An operation can be defined as a comparison or a swap between elements.

Additionally, modify the plot\_sorting\_performance(algorithms) function to incorporate the operation counters for each sorting algorithm. The modified function should plot the performance of the sorting algorithms in terms of both execution time and the number of operations as a function of the length of the input array.
